    {#This document describes the syntax and semantics of the
    template engine and will be most useful as reference to those
    creating Jinja templates. As the template engine is very
    flexible, the configuration from the application
    can be slightly different from the code presented
    here in terms of delimiters and behavior of undefined values.


    The default syntax of Jinja2 matches Django syntax in many ways. However this similarity doesn’t mean that you can
    use a Django template unmodified in Jinja2. For example filter arguments use a function call syntax rather than a
    colon to separate filter name and arguments. Additionally the extension interface in Jinja is fundamentally
    different from the Django one which means that your custom tags won’t work any longer.
